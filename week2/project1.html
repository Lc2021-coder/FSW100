	  <h2><b>The Green House Affect</b></h2>
	  <h3><b>We Live In A Greenhouse</b></h3>
	  <p>Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About the light reaching Earth atomshere passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and then radiated upward in the form of infrared heat. About 90 percent of this heat is then absorded by greenhouse gases and radiated back toward the surface.</p>

	  <p>Scientist attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th centuryto the human expansion of the "greenhouse effect"- warming that results when the atomshere traps heat radiating from the earth upward space.</p>

	  <p>Certain gases in the atomsphere block heat from escaping. Long lived gaes that remain semi permanently in the atomsphere and do not respond physically and chemicallly to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically and chemically to changes in temperature are seen as "feedbacks".</p>

	  <p>Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:
		  <ul>
			  <li>Nitrous Oxide</li>
			  <li>Carbon Dioxide</li>
			  <li>Methane</li>
			  <li>Water Vapor</li>
